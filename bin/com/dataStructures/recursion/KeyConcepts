Recursion:

	>> Recursion is something where function calls itself in order to
	complete the given task.
	>> It divides the complex problem into simpler steps like stack of steps.
	
	example programs:
	
		>> printing numbers from 1 to n
		>> printing numbers from n to 1
		>> finding the factorial to n
		>> printing the fibonacci series
		>> use recursion of for loop for simple tasks
